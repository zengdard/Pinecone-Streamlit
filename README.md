This script uses Pinecone, Streamlit, and OpenAI APIs to create a simple search engine that returns the most similar text snippets from a pre-indexed dataset based on a user's query. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Import the necessary libraries: `pinecone`, `streamlit`, `time`, and `openai`.
2. Set the OpenAI model to be used for text embedding (`MODEL = "text-embedding-ada-002"`).
3. Initialize the Pinecone client with an API key and environment, and set the index name (`stendhalgpt`).
4. Define a function `search` that takes a query and an optional `top_k` parameter (default is 5). This function uses the OpenAI API to generate an embedding for the query and then queries the Pinecone index with the embedding to retrieve the most similar results.
5. Display some information and a text area for the user to input their query.
6. If the user has entered a query, use the `search` function to retrieve the most similar results, and display them in expandable sections using Streamlit's `st.expander` function. Each section displays the similarity score, title, text snippet, site, and URL for the result.

Note that the script assumes that the Pinecone index has already been created and populated with text data that has been pre-processed and embedded using the same OpenAI model.

Also, the script includes a `time.sleep(3)` call after the search query to simulate a delay in the search process and display a spinner using Streamlit's `st.spinner` function.
